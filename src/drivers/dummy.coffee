# # Dummy Player Driver
#
# This driver provides a dummy player object and driver for development purposes.
#
# As soon as the player driver is comfortable, it can register itself with the Video Annotator framework by calling
# the OAC.Client.StreamingVideo.Player.register function with a callback. The register function will call this
# callback with a plain JavaScript object that should be filled in with the following properties:
#
OAC.Client.StreamingVideo.Player.register 'Dummy', (driver) ->

	#
	# ## getAvailablePlayers
	#
	# Returns all player DOM objects available on the page, that can be controlled with this driver.
	# All of the DOM objects will be passed individually to the #bindPlayer method. The returned binding
	# objects will be passed to any callbacks passed to OAC.Client.StreamingVideo.Player.onNewPlayer().
	#
	#
	driver.getAvailablePlayers = ->
		index = 0
		for p in $('.dummyplayer')
			player = $(p).data 'player'
			if not player?
				player = initDummyPlayer p, index
				$(p).data 'player', player
				player.startDummyPlayer()
			index += 1
			player
	
	#
	# ## getOACVersion
	#
	# Returns the version number of the API the player driver is implementing. "1.0" is the only option for now.
	#	
	driver.getOACVersion = -> "1.0"

	#
	# ## bindPlayer
	#
	# Takes the DOM object and binds it to a JavaScript object that provides the OAC player API.
	# The binding is then used by the Video Annotator to manage the player.
	#
	driver.bindPlayer = (playerObj) ->
		#
		# OAC.Client.StreamingVideo.Player.DriverBinding is the MITHgrid super class for
		# driver bindings.
		#
		OAC.Client.StreamingVideo.Player.DriverBinding.initInstance (that) ->
			#
			# We begin by binding appropriate events in the DOM object to the
			# event firers in the driver binding object.
			#
			
			#
			# We fire the onPlayheadUpdate event when the player fires the onplayheadupdate event.
			#
			playerObj.onplayheadupdate ->
				that.events.onPlayheadUpdate.fire that.getPlayhead()
			
			#
			## Player Driver API
			#
			# The following methods are expected for the player driver binding.
			#

			#
			# ### getCoordinates
			#
			# Returns the current player coordinates (left, top) on screen.
			#
			that.getCoordinates = -> (parseInt(c, 10) for c in playerObj.getcoordinates())

			#
			# ### getSize
			#
			#	Returns the video size (width, height) of current player.
			#
			that.getSize = -> (parseInt(s, 10) for s in playerObj.getsize())

			#
			# ### getTargetURI
			#
			# Returns the targetURI that should be used in an OAC annotation. This should represent the
			# video being played by the player.
			#
			that.getTargetURI = playerObj.getTargetURI
			
			#
			# ### play
			#
			# Starts playing the video.
			#
			that.play = playerObj.play

			#
			# ### pause
			#
			# Stops playing the video.
			#
			that.pause = playerObj.pause

			#
			# ### getPlayhead
			#
			# Returns the current play head position
			#
			that.getPlayhead = playerObj.getplayhead

			#
			# ### setPlayhead
			#
			# Sets the play head value to a certain position.
			#
			# Parameters:
			#
			# * value - New play head value
			#
			that.setPlayhead = playerObj.setplayhead
