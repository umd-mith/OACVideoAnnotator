# # Player
#
# The Video Annotator provides a central video player registry. Video player drivers register a set of callbacks
# that are used to discover available video players and bind them to a MITHgrid-based object that provides a
# standard API for managing the player.
#
# The various functions that make up the registry are static functions: they aren't methods on a particular
# object instance.
#
OAC.Client.StreamingVideo.namespace "Player", (exports) ->

  players = []

  # ## player
  #
  # Returns the DOM object for a certain player loaded on the page.
    #
  # Parameters:
  #
  # * playerId (optional) - Player ID, a sequential number that identifies a player on a page. If not provided, it takes the first player available.
  #
  # Returns:
  #
  # A player's DOM object.
  #
  # Examples:
  #
  #     OAC.Client.StreamingVideo.Player.player().pause()
  #     OAC.Client.StreamingVideo.Player.player(1).play()
  #
  exports.player = (playerId) ->
    if !playerId?
      playerId = 0
    players[playerId]

  # ## onNewPlayer
  #
  # This event is used by applications making use of the PlayerController to discover configured players.
  #
  # Examples:
  #
  #     OAC.Client.StreamingVideo.Player.onNewPlayer.addListener(function(player) {
  #       -- do something with player
  #     });
  #
  exports.onNewPlayer = MITHgrid.initEventFirer(false, false, true)

  # ## register
  #
  # Used by drivers to let this object know which drivers are avalable and to initialize them.
  #
  # Parameters:
  #
  # * driverObjectCB - callback function that defines the functions needed to access driver objects
  #
  # Returns: Nothing.
  #
  # Examples:
  #
  #     OAC.Client.StreamingVideo.Player.register(function(driverObject) {
  #       driverObject.getAvailablePlayers = function() { ... };
  #       driverObject.bindPlayer = function(player) { ... };
