### About Video Annotator

The Video Annotator developer library is the result of an experiment run as part of the
[Open Annotation](http://www.openannotation.org) collaboration to test the 
[OA data model](http://www.openannotation.org/spec/beta/) 
for use in exchanging annotations of streaming video.

### Using Video Annotator

The library gives you the components you need to add annotation capabilities to videos embedded in your web pages. Check out
the source code for [the demo](/OACVideoAnnotator/demo.html) to see how it works. The library has support for HTML 5
video tags. We welcome drivers for other video players.
